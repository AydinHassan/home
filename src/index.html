                        <div>
                            <p>PHP School is a project created by me to help others to learn to code for free using an open source learning system.

                                We created a framework for teaching programming concepts and verifying the written the code. We hope for a community to develop with many workshops which will provide free programming education for as many topics as there are workshops created. Essentially a platform where people can create lesson plans and the system does everything else.

                                There are also enterprise opportunities available which we are investigating for consulting and helping businesses teach people how to use their tools and processes.</p>

                        <p class="font-medium mb-2 text-grey-dark">August 2013 - August 2017</p>
                        <p class="text-grey-darker">I progressed from Junior developer to a lead developer in my time at JH. I have worked on many projects during my time there and worked at every stage of the project from planning, road map meetings, development, testing and maintenance.

                            I implemented many processes during my time at JH and built and maintained many automation tools to improve the throughput of the development team. A subset of these include automating deploys, updating code versioning, migrating 100+ projects to GitHub, improving and creating tools to manage dependencies, introducing unit testing to the team and teaching and mentoring them how to write unit tests. With this we saw a dramatic decrease of bugs and a massive decrease in the time needed to fix any other bugs found. I introduced continuous integration to our workflow using all of the above techniques. I've also contributed many fixes to Magento 2.

                            A small set of the clients I worked for at JH: Hype For Type, Swoon Editions, Bench, Selco, FPS.</p>
